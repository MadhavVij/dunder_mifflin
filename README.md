This is a solution for [problem statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/l8nabp/munder_difflin_needs_a_newly_selftaught_python/)

Mr Dwight, Regional Manager of Munder Difflin, requires a basic python programme to invoice his clients. He would [like this spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zYnLnRcNpQFNnFm0QX3-crg1veM0JX4m/view?usp=sharing) to be updated with each sale he makes and for the invoice to be emailed automatically to the client. Mr Dwight is comfortable with Python IDEs and doesn't need a graphical user interface. Mr Dwight's pesky colleague Tim Palhert disabled his email access, so Mr Dwight can use any email address to send invoices. He will run the programme after each sale.

The programme should ask Mr Dwight for the following details:
- The client's email address
- Client's name
- Clients address
- The description of the sale
- The cost to the client
- An invoice number
- Today's date
- A due date


If you manage to complete Mr Dwight's programme, he also mentioned some additional features that he would like for the programme:
- The invoice number to generate automatically and follow a system
- A second spreadsheet to record his outgoing invoices
- The ability to add discounts to invoices
- Today's date to be automatically added rather than having to input it for each sale
- A quantity section
- The ability to bill for more than one product on the invoice
